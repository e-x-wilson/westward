# westward

A portfolio project after coming off a few months of learning Unity since Javascript is my trade tool.

# run it

```
// Download the project and...

npm ci

// Open an emulator with android studio

react-native run-android
```

You may need the react-native CLI installed or something I'm not sure.

And I haven't tested with XCode nor will I till late into this. I have a Pixel.
