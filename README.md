# westward

A React Native game with simple GPS mapping as the backdrop for a turn-based RPG set in 
the 19th century Western Expansion movement.

A semi-blatant ripoff of the game Orna which can be found in at least the Google Play Store
and probably also the App Store. I wanted to copycat it for a portfolio project after coming 
off a few months of learning Unity since Javascript is my trade tool.
